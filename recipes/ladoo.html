        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            Laddu or laddoo is a spherical sweet from the Indian subcontinent made of various ingredients and sugar syrup or jaggery. It has been described as "perhaps the most universal and ancient of Indian sweets."
            Laddus are often served during celebrations and religious festivals, especially those associated with the Hindu deity Ganesha.
