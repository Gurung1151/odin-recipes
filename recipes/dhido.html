        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 
            Dhindo is a meal prepared in Nepal. It is prepared by gradually adding flour to boiling water while stirring. It is a staple meal in various parts of Nepal,
            specially Tamangs in the Hilly Region of Nepal and the Sikkim and Darjeeling regions of India. Though it is a staple food in Nepal, dhindo has previously 
            been seen as an inferior food compared to rice, and was associated with low status.The inclusion of dhindo on urban restaurant menus has coincided with a rise in the food's prestige, possibly attributable to the changing perception of Nepal's indigenous crops, which are now recognized for their nutritional advantage.
